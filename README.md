# ☕ Café — The AI-Native, On-Chain Dev Hub

> ✨ Building the Self-Writing Internet

Café is a decentralized collaboration platform for developers and Web3 teams. It combines tamper-proof code hosting, live coding sessions, and intelligent Caffeine AI agents — all built natively on the Internet Computer Protocol.

## 🌐 Why Café?

Traditional development tools are fragmented and centralized. GitHub for repos, Slack for chat, Notion for docs, AI tools in another tab. Café brings everything together at one virtual table.

With Café, you can:

- Host code **on-chain** using Internet Computer canisters
- Collaborate in **real-time**, Google Docs-style
- Get live AI assistance from **Caffeine AI agents**
- Onboard new contributors with **context-aware AI guides**
- Track contributions via **Principal IDs**
- Run projects as **modular DAOs** with transparent governance

## 🔥 Features

- **Real-Time Pair Programming** with AI and peers
- **On-Chain Git** alternative for decentralized hosting
- **AI-Powered PR Reviews**, Commit Suggestions, and Code Docs
- **Contributor Transparency** via Principal Identity
- **DAO-Based Project Management**
- **Invite collaborators** to your dev table instantly
